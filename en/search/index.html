The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing German data on the SDG indicators and for statistical reporting on Germany’s progress in this field. This website enables the international organizations (custodian agencies) responsible for single indicators to directly download the data for their SDG indicators and use them in the global reporting. In addition, it provides to the interested public constantly updated information on the status of Germany’s SDG indicators and detailed information on their calculation methodology.\n\nAlthough the SDG indicators are primarily intended to measure the achievement of objectives rather on international than on national scale, many of the global indicators can also be calculated nationally. This compilation of the indicators available for Germany is based both on data from official statistics and from other sources. Time series are available at national level for a large number of global indicators and are published here on the national reporting platform. There are several reasons why statistical data are not available for all of the globally agreed indicators: For certain internationally relevant indicators it may not be reasonable to transfer them onto the national level. Other indicators are policy indicators which may not be measured statistically at all. For other indicators, not all the basic statistical data required to calculate them are available yet.\n\nIn some cases, data are available for Germany with minor methodological differences from the internationally agreed definitions. In other cases, however, only time series with major deviations from the globally defined calculation methodology are available. This may result in Custodian Agency, responsible for the indicator, altering the provided data in order to achieve comparability on the international scale. Accordingly, the time series found in the global SDG-database for Germany may differ from those provided here. The extent to which the published data correspond to the global calculation methodology is described under “Comparability with UN metadata” under each indicator.\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_guidance/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_guidance/","title":"Technical instructions\n","content":"Open source project on GitHub\n\nThe SDG online platform is a publicly accessible tool for the dissemination and presentation of German data for the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda.\n\nTo comply with the United Nations‘ basic principles for official statistics, the minimum characteristics of an SDG online platform should be the following: \nThe SDG online platform\n\n  is managed by the national statistical offices;\n  contains official statistics and metadata according to a standard methodology that has proved its worth;\n  is publicly available;\n  allows feedback from data users;\n  is operated using open source (free) technologies.\n\n\nIn addition, the SDG online platform has been developed according to recognised international guidelines, in particular regarding freely accessible data and software.\n\nSources\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national online platforms, in particular as open source solutions for the presentation of SDG indicators. Pioneers in this area are the USA and Great Britain. The current version of the German online platform was developed on the basis of an earlier version of the British online platform and adapted to the needs of German statistics. The project code for the SDG online platform is publicly available in the Github repository.\n\nA universal version of the codes for an online platform developed by the United States, Great Britain and the Center for Open Data Enterprise is available. The SDG online platform is based on this. If you are interested, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with the SDG online platforms of the United States and Great Britain and the relevant Open SDG project documentation. This contains technical instructions on how to make a copy of the Open SDG online platform.\n\n\n  \n    SDG online platform of the United States\n  \n  \n    SDG online platform of Great Britain\n  \n\n\nIf you have comments or feedback on the Open SDG project or would like to participate in the Open SDG community, please contact Open SDG GitHub.\n\nApplied technology\n\nBack-end IT requirements:\n\n  GitHub: hosting website designed for programming projects using the Git version control system\n  Jekyll: generator of static pages written in Ruby\n\n\nFront-end IT requirements:\n\n  XHTML, CSS, JavaScript\n  Chartist: JavaScript library that offers customizable and responsive charts\n  Bootstrap: framework CSS\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_navigation/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_navigation/","title":"Navigation\n","content":"Layout of the SDG online platform\n\nThe online platform comprises two components, namely the German set of indicators for the global sustainability goals (Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the indicator set of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). Since the German Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda at the national level, indicators shared by both strategies are linked to each other on the platform.\n\nA direct link to the homepage of the DNS online platform can be found at the top right of this page next to the search field: \n\nStructure of the SDG online platform\n\nTThe SDG online platform comprises goals, targets and related indicators (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 1: Example of the structure of SDGs based on goal 11 “Sustainable Cities and Communities“ (as of July 2020)\n\n\n\nPresentation of SDG indicators\n\nEach SDG indicator is displayed on a separate page. Depending on the indicator, different selection menus are shown on the left. The first selection menu contains all time series available for the indicator. In the sub-menus you can select various variable values depending on the data series - e.g. different age groups.\n\nThe development of the time series is visualised in a chart. Click on the second tab next to “Chart“ to view, in a table, the data underlying the chart and all other data available from the selection menus (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 2: Example of the presentation of SDG indicators using indicator 11.7.1 (as of April 2020)\n\n\n\nBelow, there are green buttons that allow the data to be downloaded in CSV format and, in the case of the chart, also as a PNG file.\n\nMetadata and data sources\n\nAt the bottom of the indicator pages you can see the following three tabs: “National Metadata“, “Global Metadata“ and “Data Sources“.\n\nThe “National Metadata“ tab provides a list of the national time series which correspond most closely to the global metadata. The national metadata sheet includes a comparison with the global requirements and related methodological and country-specific information.\n\nEach SDG indicator is managed by one or more custodian agencies. The custodian agencies, in consultation with the IAEG-SDGs, a statistical working group of the United Nations, determine the exact definition of and methodology for the respective indicator and publish these as global metadata. These can be found in the “Global metadata“ tab (Fig. 3). In addition to the indicator‘s detailed target, the Tier classification of the indicator is listed here as well.\n\nThe “Data sources“ tab provides links to the organisation(s) that submitted the data for the time series and, where possible, also direct links to the relevant data sources.\n\nComparison of SDG and DNS indicators\n\nThere are numerous overlaps between the indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS).\n\nAbout half of the DNS- indicators are similar to or congruent with the SDG- indicators. Both sets of indicators are also structured according to the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, as the DNS represents the national implementation ofGerman Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the global agenda. at the national level. More information on the DNSGerman strategy can be found in the “Useful information“ section „Interesting Facts“ andunder DNS.\n\nHowever, there are also differences. The names of the DNS indicators and especially their numbering are not identical to those of the SDG indicators. If an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Position of the direct link to similar or congruent indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the German Sustainable Development Strategy (as of July 2020)\n\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_platform/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_platform/","title":"The online platform\n","content":"The online platform comprises two components, namely the German set of indicators for the global sustainability goals (Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the indicator set of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). Since the German Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda at the national level, indicators shared by both strategies are linked to each other on the platform.\n\nThe time series of the indicators of both online platforms are available for download.\n\nA direct link to the homepage of the DNS online platform can be found at the top right of this page next to the search field: \n\nBoth sets of indicators are structured according to the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Accordingly, the icons and the colours chosen for the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) which are used here and on the DNS online platform correspond to those of the United Nations. The icons are protected by copyright.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 1: 17 SDG icons of the United Nations used on the SDG online platform for Germany\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 2: 17 inverted SDG icons of the United Nations and the N in the circle of the German Sustainable Development Strategy used on the DNS online platform\n\n\n\n\nAim and background\n\nThe aim of the SDG online platform is to present the indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Germany.\n\nThe SDGs are anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015 and thus agreed by all Member States. The Agenda has provided the basis for shaping global economic progress in accordance with social justice and within the ecological limits of the earth.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SDG indicator data for Germany. The SDG online platform enables the competent international organisations (custodian agencies) to directly download the data for individual SDG indicators and use them, for example, for global reporting assignments given to them by the United Nations (Fig. 3). It also provides constantly updated information on the status of the German SDG indicators and detailed information on the methodology used for calculating these indicators.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Data flow for calculating the SDG indicators for Germany\n\n\n\nIn some cases the data for Germany include minor methodological deviations from the specifications of the competent custodian agencies. In other cases only time series are available which are affected by larger deviations from the globally defined calculation methodology (for more information, see “About us“ and Navigation in the section on global metadata). This may lead to the respective custodian agencies adjusting the data provided to ensure international comparability. Therefore, the time series found in the Global SDG Indicators Database may differ from the time series provided here.\n\nPossible amendments until 2030\n\nThe existing set of indicators is undergoing two major revisions in 2020 (already completed) and 2025. The IAEG-SDGs (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators) has been commissioned to coordinate these revisions. During the revisions, new indicators may be added to the set, and existing indicators may be replaced or removed. The changes will be incorporated as quickly as possible on the SDG online platform.\n\nComparison of SDG and DNS indicators\n\nThe United Nations SDG indicators and their numbering are not identical to the DNS indicators. If an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 4: Button providing a link to the related DNS indicator (highlighted)\n\n\n\nTechnical background\n\nTo present the data for each participating country in a formatted form, the open source project Open SDG offers a standardised template of an online platform on GitHub.

The 2030 Agenda, developed by the Member States of the United Nations, is a roadmap for “Transforming our world for the better“, aimed at achieiving a sustainable transformation in social, economic and environmental terms by 2030. It comprises 17 global goals that are subdivided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators. The goals are called Sustainable Development Goals and are abbreviated as SDGs (Fig. 1).\n\nMonitoring goal achievement\n\nThe United Nations Statistical Commission was mandated to develop global indicators for the targets together with the national statistical offices. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) established for this purpose presented a set of indicators and has continuously refined it. The IAEG-SDGs is composed of statistical offices of some Member States of the United Nations, including the Federal Statistical Office representing Germany.\n\nNational reporting on sustainable development in Germany\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SGD indicator data for Germany and for statistical reporting on Germany’s progress in this field.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office launched this online platform on the indicators of the UN global Sustainable Development Goals. Here time series and associated metadata regarding global sustainable development are provided in a processed and interactive form for Germany. The SDGs section of the online platform enables the competent international organisations (custodian agencies) to directly download Germany’s SDG indicator data and use them, for example, for global reporting assignments.\n","id":""},"/en/en/facts_dns/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/facts_dns/","title":"German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS)\n","content":"The target values to be achieved within the framework of the German Sustainability Strategy, the indicators, their data basis and calculations as well as the graphical representations have been agreed by the Federal Government. The Federal Statistical Office was part of the process in a consultative role. The structure of the German Sustainability Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included in the German Sustainability Strategy in a thematically corresponding way.\n\nSince 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been responsible for measuring the national indicators in a professionally independent process using its own data from official statistics and for coordinating the integration of data from other agencies. For this reason, in addition to the Sustainability Strategy indicators now published on the online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an indicator report for the German Sustainability Strategy every two years (most recently in 2021).\n","id":""},"/en/en/faq/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n","content":"How do I suggest new or different data sources?\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please contact us here {{site.email_contacts.questions}}.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nWe have used four different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:\n\n\n  Green: Reported online – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.\n  Orange: In progress - a suitable data source has been identified. The corresponding time series are currently being processed to be included in this reporting platform.\n  Red: Not available - No data is available for this indicator.\n  Grey: Not applicable - This indicator is marked as not applicable for the provision of national time series.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nHow are data gaps filled?\nIn case there are no data available for an indicator, possible data sources are sought and assessed according to our quality standards. If they pass, the indicator is published in the reporting platform.\n\nFor some indicators, although there may be data available at the national level, the existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all required categories.\n\nThus, either  new data sources need to be found, or existing ones to be linked, or data to be model. This is constantly supported by the respective thematic department in the Federal Statistical Office.\n\nWhat does disaggregation mean?\nDisaggregation is used to assess an indicator in more detail by dividing it into subcategories. The most common ones are age or gender. Every indicator has its own specific set of disaggregation categories which are provided either in the indicator’s name or by the international organization responsible for the indicator.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\nThe website may be used by other countries to build their own national reporting platform.
