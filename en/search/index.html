The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing German data on the SDG indicators and for statistical reporting on Germany’s progress in this field. This website enables the international organizations (custodian agencies) responsible for single indicators to directly download the data for their SDG indicators and use them in the global reporting. In addition, it provides to the interested public constantly updated information on the status of Germany’s SDG indicators and detailed information on their calculation methodology.\n\nAlthough the SDG indicators are primarily intended to measure the achievement of objectives rather on international than on national scale, many of the global indicators can also be calculated nationally. This compilation of the indicators available for Germany is based both on data from official statistics and from other sources. Time series are available at national level for a large number of global indicators and are published here on the national reporting platform. There are several reasons why statistical data are not available for all of the globally agreed indicators: For certain internationally relevant indicators it may not be reasonable to transfer them onto the national level. Other indicators are policy indicators which may not be measured statistically at all. For other indicators, not all the basic statistical data required to calculate them are available yet.\n\nIn some cases, data are available for Germany with minor methodological differences from the internationally agreed definitions. In other cases, however, only time series with major deviations from the globally defined calculation methodology are available. This may result in Custodian Agency, responsible for the indicator, altering the provided data in order to achieve comparability on the international scale. Accordingly, the time series found in the global SDG-database for Germany may differ from those provided here. The extent to which the published data correspond to the global calculation methodology is described under “Comparability with UN metadata” under each indicator.\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_guidance/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_guidance/","title":"Guide NRP","content":"National reporting platform - SDG\n\nThe national reporting platform - SDG (SDG - NRP) is a publicly available tool serving the dissemination and presentation of data for Germany on  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations (UN).\n\nOur approach to NRP\n\nIn order to conform with the UN’s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the minimum characteristics an SDG NRP should have are that it should: \n\n  be managed by national statistical offices;\n  features official statistics and metadata according to established standard methodology;\n  be publicly accessible;\n  allows for feedback from data users;\n  features open source (free) technology.\n\n\nIn addition, the German SDG-NRP has been developed in accordance with recognized international guidelines, especially with regard to open data and software.\n\nNRP - sources\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national reporting platforms, in particular as an open source solution for the presentation of SDG indicators. Precursors in this field are the USA and Great Britain. The current version of the German reporting platform has been developed based on an earlier version of the UK NRP, and adapted to the needs of German statistics. The project code is publicly available in a Github repository.\n\nThe new universal version of the open-SDG platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the national US and UK platforms for SDGs and the Open SDG project documentation, which includes technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.\n\n\n  \n    US NPR SDG\n  \n  \n    UK NPR SDG\n  \n\n\nIf you have any comments or feedback on the Open SDG project, or want to get involved with the Open SDG community, please get in touch by raising an issue on the Open SDG GitHub.\n\nNRP - applied technology\n\nBack-end IT requirements:\n\n  GitHub: hosting website designed for programming projects using the Git version control system.\n  Jekyll: generator of static pages written in Ruby\n\n\nFront-end IT requirements:\n\n  XHTML, CSS, JavaScript\n  Chartist: JavaScript library that offers customizable and responsive charts\n  Bootstrap: framework CSS\n\n\nCurrent display\n\nDue to technical difficulties, the current version of the German NRP contains some faulty illustrations, which are referred to here:\n\n  Integers are displayed without decimal places (even in time series in which other numerical values with decimal places exist).\n  Very long names of time series are not broken up into several lines in the axis labels of the graphics and hence are partly cut off.\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_navigation/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_navigation/","title":"Navigation","content":"Layout of the reporting platform\n\nThere are two sections of this reporting platform. The one where you are currently located displays the indicator set of the Sustainable Development Goals. The other section of the platform provides the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). In both sections the time series on the respective indicators can be downloaded by interested visitors.\n\nNext to the search box in the upper right corner of this page there is a direct link to the starting page of the national reporting platform to the indicator section of the German Sustainable Development Strategy: \n\nStructure of the SDG part of the platform\n\nThe SDG part of the platform is organised into goals, targets and the related SDG indicators (figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1: Example for the structure of the SDGs via goal 11 „Sustainable Cities and Communities“ (as of 07/2020)\n\n\n\nPresentation of single SDG indicators\n\nEvery SDG indicator is presented on an own page. Depending on the SDG indicator, there are different selection menus presented on the left hand side of each page. The first menu contains all time series that are available for this indicator. Depending on the time series, you can choose different values in the provided sub-menus below – i.e. different age classes.\n\nThe development of a time series is visualised in a chart. On the second tab “Table” – next to “Chart” – the chart data and all available data related from the sub-menus can be viewed (please have a look at figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 2: Example for an SDG indicator page on the German reporting platform (as of 07/2020)\n\n\n\nBelow the chart there are green buttons that allow data downloads in csv format and, in case of the chart, as well as a png file.\n\nMetadata and data sources\n\nAt the bottom of the indicator page three tabs are shown:\n“National Metadata”, “Global Metadata”, and “Data Sources”\n\nBelow the tab “National Metadata” the national time series that are available and fit best the global metadata are listed. In addition, a comparison to the global metadata as well as further methodical and country-specific information on the time series can be found in the related national metadata sheet.\n\nEvery SDG indicator is administrated by one or more Custodian Agencies. After consultation with the IAEG-SDG, a statistical UN working group, the Custodian Agencies define the methodological guidelines for the calculation of the respective SDG indicator and publish those as global metadata. The global metadata can be found below the tab of the same name (figure 3). Here, the target is added in full length, as well as the Tier classification of the SDG indicator.\n\nBelow „Data Sources“ there are web links to the organisation:s, that provided the data for the time series, and – if possible – there are web links directly to the particular data source.\n\nComparison of SDG and DNS indicators\n\nThere are several overlaps in content in between the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals and the German Sustainable Development Strategy.\n\nApproximately half of the DNS indicators are similar or congruent with SDG indicators. Furthermore, both indicator sets are structured according to the 17 Goals of the UN agenda 2030, since the DNS represents the national implementation of the global agenda. More information about the DNS you can find in the category “Interesting Facts” and DNS.\n\nHowever, there are also differences. The name and especially the numbering of the DNS indicators is not identical with the SDG indicators. If there is a DNS indicator comparable to an SDG indicator, there is a button on the indicator page with a direct link to the respective indicator (figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3: Position of the direct link to similar or congruent indicators in SDGs and DNS (as of 07/2020)\n\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_platform/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_platform/","title":"About the reporting platform for the SDGs","content":"There are two sections of this reporting platform. The one where you are currently located displays the indicator set of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030. The other section of the platform provides the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). In both sections the time series on the respective indicators can be downloaded by interested visitors.\n\nNext to the search box in the upper right corner of this page there is a direct link to the starting page of the national reporting platform to the indicator section on the German Sustainability Development Strategy: \n\nBoth sets of indicators are organised according to the 17 goals of the UN-Agenda 2030. Thus, the symbols and the colouring of the 17 goals that are used here and on the DNS-part of the reporting platform (figures 1 and 2) are copyright protected by the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1: 17 icons of the SDGs of the United Nations, used on the SDG-part of the reporting platform Germany\n\n\n\n\n Figure 2: 17 inverted icons of the SDGs of the United Nations, and the N in a circle of the German Sustainable Development Strategy, used on the DNS-part of the reporting platform Germany\n\n\n\n\nAim and background\n\nThe SDGs are nested in the Agenda 2030 which was adopted in 2015 by the UN General Assembly, and thus by all its member states. The Agenda lays the foundation to shape global economic progress in harmony with social justice and within the ecological limits of the planet.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office coordinates and publishes the national data to the SDG indicators for Germany. The national reporting platform for SDG indicators at hand enables the responsible Custodian Agencies to directly download national data for single SDG indicators and integrate them into their global reporting on SDGs (Figure 3). The interested public can find continually updated information on the status of the SDG indicators in Germany and detailed national metadata regarding the calculation methodology of the reported time series.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3: Data flow for calculating the SDG indicators regarding Germany\n\n\n\nIn some cases, national data for Germany are available with only minor methodological differences from the global specifications made by Custodian Agencies. In other cases, these deviations are larger (for more information, see the “About us” category and Navigation in the Global Metadata section). This may result in a manipulation of the national data provided to the responsible Custodian Agency to ensure international comparability. Therefore, the time series found in the global SDG database for Germany may differ from the time series provided here.\n\nPossible Amendments until 2030\n\nThe present indicator set is undergoing two major revisions in 2020 (already passed) and 2025. The revisions are co-ordinated by the IAEG-SDG (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators). Among other things, during the revisions, new indicators may be added to the set; existing ones may be replacing or even removed.

It has been adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. The Agenda 2030 of the United Nations is a roadmap for sustainable transformation of society, economy and environment by 2030. The Agenda 2030 contains 17 global goals divided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators. The goals are called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Figure 1).\n\nReviewing the goal achievement\n\nThe UN Statistical Commission was assigned to develop global indicators for the targets together with the national statistical offices. The mandated „Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators” (IAEG-SDGs) continuously edits and regularly presents a set of indicators for this purpose. The IAEG-SDGs consists of statistical offices of 27 UN member states, including Germany represented by the Federal Statistical Office.\n\nNational Reporting about sustainable development\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office coordinates and publishes the national data for Germany to the SDG indicators.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office released this national reporting platform for indicators to the Sustainable Development Goals. On this platform, time series and related metadata regarding Germany in the light of the global sustainable development are presented in an edited and interactive way. Now the SDG-section of this platform enables the responsible Custodian Agencies and the interested public to directly download data for single SDG indicators and use them for their global reporting.\n","id":""},"/en/en/facts_dns/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/facts_dns/","title":"About the DNS","content":"In 2002, the initial German Sustainability Strategy was published, consisting of individually chosen goals, indicator fields, and postulates.\n\n2017 the national strategy was adjusted as a response to the Agenda 2030 of the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The strategy is now called German Sustainable Development Strategy. As part of the adjustments at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included. The Federal Government determined the target values, as well as the indicators, their database, and calculations.\n\nSince 2006 the Federal Statistical Office is assigned by the Federal Government to report every two years about the target achievement of the German Sustainable Development Strategy. The information is published as indicator report. It is available in a printed and in a digital version. Since 2020 the development of the indicators is also published on the reporting platform.\n","id":""},"/en/en/faq/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","content":"How do I suggest new or different data sources?\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please contact us here {{site.email_contacts.questions}}.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nWe have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:\n\n\n  Green: Reported online – as a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.\n  Amber: Statistics in progress – we have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.\n  Red: Exploring data sources – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nHow are data gaps filled?\nIn case there are no data available for an indicator, possible data sources are sought and assessed according to our quality standards. If they pass, the indicator is published in the reporting platform.\n\nFor some indicators, although there may be data available at the national level, the existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all required categories.\n\nThus, either  new data sources need to be found, or existing ones to be linked, or data to be model. This is constantly supported by the respective thematic department in the Federal Statistical Office.\n\nWhat does disaggregation mean?\nDisaggregation is used to assess an indicator in more detail by dividing it into subcategories. The most common ones are age or gender. Every indicator has its own specific set of disaggregation categories which are provided either in the indicator’s name or by the international organization responsible for the indicator.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\nThe website may be used by other countries to build their own national reporting platform.

Precursors in this field are the USA and Great Britain. The current version of the German reporting platform has been developed based on an earlier version of the UK NRP, and adapted to the needs of German statistics. The project code is publicly available in a Github repository.\n\nThe new universal version of the open-SDG platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available.

We received 111 responses from a wide variety of sectors. This report is our response to your feedback.\n\nSustainable Development Goals: progress and possibilities, 9 November 2017\nThis is our first report on the progress we’ve made towards measuring the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators in the UK. It looks at the work we have been doing to be able to measure our progress and explains how we are already sharing the data we have.\n\nGoal 3 Good health and well-being\n\nUK drops in European child mortality rankings, 13 October 2017\nThis short story looks at the two indicators (under five and neonatal mortality) under Target 3.2, showing that although the UK has seen improvements over the last forty years, the rate of improvement has slowed compared with some other EU countries.\n\nGoal 5 Gender Equality\n\nEliminating violence against women and girls: Women most at risk of experiencing partner abuse, 31 May 2018\nThis analysis looks at personal and household characteristics such as age, disability, ethnicity, sexual identity, religion, employment, marital status and household income - it shows that some groups of women are more likely to be victims of abuse by a partner or ex-partner than others.\n\nGoal 7 Affordable and clean energy\n\nRenewable Energy in the UK, 22 November 2017\nThis SlideShare takes a look at renewable energy consumption in the UK which is under Target 7.2. It highlights that while overall energy consumption has gone down, the proportion of energy from renewable sources has risen. It shows that not all renewables are emission free and some can create pollutants, burning wood is used as an example. The UK is setting out plans to meet international commitments to reducing emissions of air pollutants.\n\nGoal 10 Reduced Inequalities\n\nMeasuring Inequalities in the UK for the Sustainable Development Goals, 26th July 2018\nThis article reports on economic inequality, measuring growth rates in income and expenditure in the UK, for all households and for the bottom 40%. It shows that the incomes of the bottom 40% in the UK have sustained a higher than average growth rate since the economic downturn in 2008, and identifies the employment and household characteristics of the bottom 40% of the income distribution.\n\nGoal 16 Peace and Justice\n\nReporting on the SDGs: People on remand in custody in England and Wales, 3rd August 2018\nThis analysis provides insight into ‘the proportion of people on remand in custody’ in England and Wales and it looks at the differences between sex, ethnicity, children and young people. It helps to show how England and Wales is performing in regards to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals target in ensuring equal access to justice for all and helps to identify vulnerable groups and those at risk of being left behind.\n","id":""},"/en/en/reporting-status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/reporting-status/","title":null,"content":"\n","id":""},"/en/en/search/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/search/","title":null,"content":"\n","id":""},"/en/3-b-3":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/en/3-b-3","title":"Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis","content":"\n Exploring data sources \nSuitable data sources for this indicator are currently being explored.\nThis indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or statistical standards are yet available.
